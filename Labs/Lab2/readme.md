# Q3.
Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as data
members—a first name (type char* (DMA)), a last name (type string) and a monthly salary
(type int). Your class should have a setter function that initializes the three data members.
Provide a getter function for each data member. If the monthly salary is not positive, set it
to 0. Write a test program that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two
Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10
percent raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again. Identify and add any other
related functions to achieve the said goal.

# Q4.
Write C++ code to represent a hitting game by using OOP concept. The details are as
follows: This game is being played between two teams (i.e. your team and the enemy
team). The total number of players in your team is randomly generated and stored
accordingly. The function generates a pair of numbers and matches each pair. If the
numbers get matched, the following message is displayed: “Enemy got hit by your team!”
Otherwise, the following message is displayed: “You got hit by the enemy team!” The
number of hits should be equal to the number of players in your team. The program should
tell the final result of your team by counting the hits of both the teams.
