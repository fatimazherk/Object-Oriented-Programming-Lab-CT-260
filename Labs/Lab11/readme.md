1. Create a C++ Program to implement login. It should accept user name and password
and throw a custom exception if the password has less than 6 characters or does not
contain a digit.
2. Create a class for dynamic stack using vectors. Implement the push( ), pop( ) and peek(
) functions. The object of stack class will be used to take any sentence as input and it
should have a method reverse( ) which will reverse each word in the string.
3. You are given N integers. Store N integers in a vector and write a function Sort for
sorting the N integers and print the sorted order. Now use the sorting algorithms
provided in STL for sorting the vector. Measure the time taken by the two methods for
sorting the vector and print the results. [Hint: You can use built-in function time( ) or
anyother built-in method for measuring the processing time of sorting operation.]
4. You are a teacher and want to keep track of your students' grades. You decide to use
the map container in C++ to store the student names as keys and their corresponding
grades as values. Design and implement a program in C++ to fulfill the following
requirements:
- Input: Prompt the user to enter the names and grades of multiple students. Allow the user to
continue entering data until they choose to stop.
- Storage: Store the student names as keys and their grades as values in a map container.
- Retrieval: Implement a function to retrieve the grade associated with a given student's name. If
the student is not found in the map, display an appropriate message.
- Update: Implement a function to update the grade of a specific student. Prompt the user to
enter the new grade and update the corresponding value in the map.
- Deletion: Implement a function to remove a student and their grade from the map based on a

given student's name.
- Display: Display all the student names and their corresponding grades stored in the map.
Testing: Write a program to test the functionality of your map implementation. Add
multiple students with their grades, retrieve grades for specific students, update grades,
delete students, and display the final list of students and their grades. As you implement
the program, consider using appropriate data types, input validation, error handling, and
clear user prompts. Remember to thoroughly test your implementation to ensure
correctness and accuracy in storing and retrieving the student grades.
5. You are hosting a party and want to keep track of the unique guests attending. To
achieve this, you decide to use the set container in C++ to store the names of the guests.
Design and implement a program in C++ to fulfill the following requirements:
- Input: Prompt the user to enter the names of multiple guests attending the party. Allow the
user to continue entering names until they choose to stop.
- Storage: Store the guest names in a set container, which will automatically enforce uniqueness
by discarding duplicate names.
- Display: Display all the unique guest names stored in the set in alphabetical order.
- Count: Display the total number of unique guests attending the party.
Testing: Write a program to test the functionality of your set implementation. Add multiple
guest names, including duplicates, and ensure that only unique names are stored in the set.
Display the final list of unique guest names and the total count of guests attending the
party. As you implement the program, consider using appropriate data types, input
validation, error handling, and clear user prompts.
