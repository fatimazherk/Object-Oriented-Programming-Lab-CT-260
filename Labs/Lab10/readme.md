# Q1.

Create a C++ Program to add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers using class
template. Two numbers can be of the same datatype or combination of different
data types.


# Q2.

Create a C++ Program to swap the data using template function, instead of calling a
function by passing a value, use call by reference, Two numbers can be of same
datatype or combination of different data types.


# Q3.

Create a C++ class called mycontainer that can store one element of any type and it
has just one member function called increase, which increases its value. But we find
that when it stores an element of type char it would be more convenient to have a
completely different implementation with a function member uppercase, declare a
class template specialization for that type.

# Q4.

Create an abstract class template for 1D dynamic array. Inherit a dynamic Queue
template class from the abstract class which must have following methods: isFull( ),
isEmpty( ), size( ), Front( ), Rear( ), enqueue( ), dequeue( ), resize( ).
