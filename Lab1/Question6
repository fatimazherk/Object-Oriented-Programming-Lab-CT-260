// Write a program to help a bank create its withdrawal system. Your program should
// allow the user to input their account type. Account types are: savings, current.
// Following business rules apply when withdrawing from a certain account:
//  Savings:
// User must provide the savings account number and code ‘S’ (for savings).
// When withdrawing from a savings account, users need to pay a set 2% of
// the money that they withdraw. If the amount of money withdrawn is over
// 50,000, then a 5% tax will be deducted. The money deducted shall be from
// the remaining money in the account.
//  Current:
// User must provide the current account number and code „C‟ (for current).
// When withdrawing from a current account, users need to pay a withdrawal
// fee of 100. If the amount of money withdrawn is over 50,000, then a 5% tax
// will be deducted. The money deducted shall be from the remaining money
// in the account.
// Assume all users have the 200,000 in their accounts, and cannot withdraw more
// than 100,000 at a time.
