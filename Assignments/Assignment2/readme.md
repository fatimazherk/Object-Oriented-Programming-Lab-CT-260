# Assignment 2

# Question 1:  
Ali is playing a game of cards. This is a special type of card in which a card is a 3 digit number (i.e. 100 - 999). He has to sort the cards in ascending order.
However, sorting will be done on the  sum of the digits. Make a C++ program to sort his cards, take user input for number of cards. Taking  input of cards number should be 
a function named get_data( … ). Sorting should be another function sort( … ) and displaying the final result should be another function display( … ).

# Question 2: 
Suppose that you are asked to store the data given in the following Table by using three arrays, one  for each column, where the index number is mapped for the record reference.
For example the Roll number in index 0 of the first array corresponds to the name in index0 of the second array and the  student marks are placed in third array on the 
a. Write a function that will sort the data according to the marks obtained. 
b. Write a function to search and print the data based on a roll number. 
c. Write a function to search and print the data based on name. 

# Question 3: 
The Physics teacher at your university needs help in grading a True/False test. The students’ IDs andtest answers are entered by the user. First input must be the answers to the test in the form: TFFTFFTTTTFFTFTFTFTT Every other input is in the form: 
student ID, followed by a blank, followed  by the student’s responses. For example, the entry: ABC54301 TFTFTFTT TFTFTFFTTFT indicates that  the student ID is ABC54301 and the answer to question 1 is True, the answer to question 2 is False, and so on. 
This student did not answer question 9. Each correct answer is awarded two points, each wrong answer  gets one point deducted, and no answer gets zero points. Write a program that processes the test data. The  output should display the list containing student’s ID, followed by the answers, followed by the test score, followed by the test grade. 
Sample Output: ABC54301 TFTFTFTT TFTFTFFTTFT 11 F 
Take the number of questions and number of students as input from the user and dynamically allocate memory  to the appropriate arrays. Assume the following grade scale: 90%–100%, A; 80%– 89.99%, B; 70%–79.99%, C; 60%–69.99%, D; and 0%–59.99%, F. 

# Question 4: 
You are required to print Pascal’s triangle. Pascal’s triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients.  Take number of rows(n) as input from user and print pattern similar to the one shown for n=6:
