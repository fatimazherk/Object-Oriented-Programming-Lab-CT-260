# Question 1 [CLO2] 
Given two numbers A and B (entered by a user), write a C++ program to check if A and B are in the golden ratio. Golden Ratio: Two numbers are said to be in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of the sum of the two numbers to the larger number. 
where, A > B > 0. 

# Question 2: [CLO2] 
A famous restaurant in town offers the year's biggest sale on its entire menu, but with certain  conditions. The 25% discount offer is valid for every bill exceeding Rs: 1500/- for lunch and  20% for dinner. An additional 10% for take away at lunch 
and 5% at dinner and 15% for mid-night. The restaurant also announced a special happy hour deal any time in a given day, where 50% discount is offer straight away but not exceeding Rs: 2500/-. Note: No discount  is offered if the payment is made using 
Credit / Debit card. Write a C++ program to calculate the customer bill for the given order. 

# Question 3: [CLO2]
Imagine you are hired by an agency to encode the message comprising of digits. Your task  is to write a 'C++-program' that would work on any generic input. The key factors of the encoding scheme are listed below: 
a) Each digit in the input would be considered in the range 1-9 only. 
b) Each digit in the input would occur only once. 
c) If the input number has an even number of digits, then the encoding message would  contain the maximum number from input as its first digit and the minimum number from  input as itssecond digit. 
d) If the input number has an odd number of digits, then the encoding message would  contain the minimum number from input as its first digit and the maximum number from  input as itssecond digit. 

# Question 4: [CLO2] 
Write a 'C++' program that takes start and end time from the user in an analog format and your challenge is to design a digital clock that will display Hours, Minutes and Seconds on 
a console from user provided start and end time. The program sample input/output will be  as follows: 
Enter Small  
Needle: 10 Enter  
large Needle: 12 
Enter largest  
Needle: 07 Digital 
Clock: 10:00:35 
Hint: Find C++ version of sleep( ) function in order to wait for a current thread for a specified time.
